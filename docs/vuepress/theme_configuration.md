## The app's looks

The content of a VuePress app is captured in `markdown`. The looks of the app 
are captured in:
- HTML, the structure of the app (not necessarily directly visible),
    it captures the elements of app one can act upon with CSS and JavaScript, and
    defines the vertical order/layout of the app,
- CSS, the style and (horizontal) layout of the app,
- JavaScript, the behavior of the app's HTML elements and their CSS,
    for example, it captures interactivity like button clicks and hoovers.
    It is also possible with JavaScript to generate HTML.
